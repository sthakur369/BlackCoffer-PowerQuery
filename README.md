# BlackCoffer-PowerQuery
Power Query is a concept to transform data, it can be done in Excel and in PowerBI is same way. 

Here we have 2 input files (Employee and Students). We have to perform Power Query operation in both the input files.

# In Employee file:
We removed unwanted rows, corrected header, add a custom column, clean null rows, add filters, and change data type. All can be done using Power Query
and in the output file, we create pivot table and slicer to analyze the data

# In Students file: 
Inside the Students file, we have multiple sheets. So first we do append the sheets with their respective counterpart. Then we do merging (Join in SQL) properly. Then we extracted only limited data i.e. female students with some filtrations.

# Web: 
Next we extracted data, particularly table format data directly from a website. Here we are extracting from Indian States population from Wikipedia. Based on different censuses we can see and analyze how the population changed in different states.

We can change any operation in POwerQuery anytime. The same functionalities are available in both Excel and PowerBI.
